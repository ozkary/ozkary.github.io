# ASP.NET Core with React

Yes, absolutely! Building an ASP.NET Core API with a React frontend app is entirely possible using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) without Visual Studio. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Node.js and npm:** Download and install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager).
* **.NET SDK:** Download and install the .NET SDK version compatible with your chosen ASP.NET Core version.
* **VS Code:** Download and install VS Code.

**Creating the ASP.NET Core API:**

1. **Open VS Code and use the terminal to create a new ASP.NET Core API project:**

```bash
dotnet new webapi
```

2. **Choose a template:** Opt for "Empty" or another minimal template, as React will handle the frontend.
3. **Install dependencies:** Use `npm install` to install necessary packages for the API, like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and others depending on your project requirements.
4. **Develop your API:** Implement your API endpoints and logic using C# within the project structure.

**Creating the React App:**

1. **Open a new terminal in VS Code.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to create the React app:**

```bash
cd ..
```

3. **Use `create-react-app` to create a new React app:**

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

4. **Navigate to the created React app directory:**

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

5. **Start the React development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

6. **Develop your React frontend:** Build the UI and connect to your API endpoints using tools like `fetch` or HTTP libraries like Axios.
7. **Configure proxy (optional):** If your API server runs on a different port than the React app, set up a proxy in `package.json` to avoid cross-origin issues during development.

**Running the application:**

1. **Start the API server:** Run `dotnet run` in the ASP.NET Core project directory.
2. **Keep the React development server running:** It should be running from the previous step.
3. **Access your application:** The app will be available in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000` for the React app and a different port for the API depending on your setup.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use extensions like "C# for Visual Studio Code" and "React" for syntax highlighting and code completion.
* Consider version control (Git) for managing your codebase.
* Explore frameworks like ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization.
* Utilize tools like Docker or Azure App Service for deployment and production environments.

Remember, this is a brief overview. You'll find numerous tutorials and resources online covering each step in detail, offering additional guidance and best practices.

I hope this helps you build your desired application using VS Code!
