After completing our data warehouse design and implementation, our data pipeline should be fully operational.  We can move forward with the analysis and visualization step of our process. Data analysis entails exploring, comprehending, and reshaping data to yield insights, thereby enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions. Conversely, data visualization employs these insights to adeptly convey information via visual elements, encompassing charts and dashboards.

## Summary

Data analysis involves meticulous exploration, transformation, and comprehension of raw data to identify meaningful insights. There are guidelines and design patterns to follow for each specific use case. A BA might focus on KPIs, while a QAE might focus on statistical analysis of process quality. These insights, however, find their true value through data visualization. A code-centric approach with Python, aided by Plotly, offers potent tools for crafting analyses and visuals, but a low-code cloud hosted solution is often the solution for broader sharing and enterprise solutions. 

In conclusion, the synergy between data analysis and visualization is pivotal for data-driven projects. Navigating data analysis with established principles and communicating insights through visually engaging dashboards empowers us to extract value from data. Whether opting for code-centric or low-code solutions, the choice of tooling and platform hinges on the balance between team expertise and target audience.

## Exercise - Data Streaming

With a better understanding of the data analysis and visualization process, the next step is to put these concepts into practice through a hands-on exercise. In this lab, we can continue our data engineering process and create a dashboard that will meet the requirements established in the discovery phase.
