The discovery process involves identifying the problem, analyzing data sources, defining project requirements, establishing the project scope, and designing an effective architecture to address the identified challenges.

In this session, we will delve into the essential building blocks of data engineering, placing a spotlight on the discovery process. From framing the problem statement to navigating the intricacies of exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub, you'll gain a solid understanding of the fundamental aspects that drive effective data engineering projects.
