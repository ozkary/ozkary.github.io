### Empowering Everyone: Code-Centric vs. Low-Code/No-Code Development

Do you enjoy diving into the code itself using tools like Visual Studio Code? Or perhaps you prefer a more visual approach, leveraging designer tools and writing code snippets when needed?

- Code-Centric Development:

 - Traditional approach where developers write code from scratch using programming languages like Python, C#, or C++.
 - Offers maximum flexibility and control over the application's functionality and performance.
 - Requires strong programming skills and a deep understanding of software development principles.

![Careers in Technology - Code vs No-Code VSCode ](../../assets/2024/ozkary-technical-career-code-vs-no-code-vscode.png) 

- Low-Code/No-Code Development:
  - User-friendly platforms that enable rapid application development with minimal coding or no coding required.
  - Utilize drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built components, and templates to streamline the development process.
  - Ideal for building simple applications, automating workflows, or creating prototypes.
