# Discovery Process - Exercise

---

In this discovery exercise lab, we examine a problem statement, conduct a thorough analysis to define the scope of work and requirements. Initial data analysis is performed by downloading sample files using Python and conducting data analysis through Jupyter Notebook.

## Problem Statement

In the city of New York, commuters use the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway system for transportation. There are millions of people that use this system every day; therefore, businesses around the subway stations would like to be able to use Geofencing advertisement to target those commuters or possible consumers and attract them to their business locations at peak hours of the day.

Geofencing is a location based technology service in which mobile devicesâ€™ electronic signal is tracked as it enters or leaves a virtual boundary (geo-fence) on a geographical location. Businesses around those locations would like to use this technology to increase their sales.

![Data Engineering Process Fundamentals - Problem Statement](images/ozkary-data-engineering-process-geo-fence.jpg "Data Engineering Process - Problem Statement")

The MTA subway system has stations around the city. All the stations are equipped with turnstiles or gates which tracks as each person enters or leaves the station. MTA provides this information in CSV files, which can be imported into a data warehouse to enable the analytical process to identify patterns that can enable these businesses to understand how to best target consumers.

## Analytical Approach

### Dataset Criteria

We are using the MTA Turnstile data for 2023. Using this data, we can investigate the following criteria:

- Stations with the high number of exits by day and hours
- Stations with high number of entries by day and hours

Exits indicates that commuters are arriving to those locations. Entries indicate that commuters are departing from those locations.

### Data Analysis Criteria

The data can be grouped into stations, date and time of the day. This data is audited in blocks of four hours apart. This means that there are intervals of 8am to 12pm as an example. We analyze the data into those time block intervals to help us identify the best times both in the morning and afternoon for each station location. This should allow businesses to target a particular geo-fence that is close to their business.

 In the discovery process, we take a look at the data that is available for our analysis. We are using the MTA turnstiles information which is available at this location:

 ðŸ‘‰ [New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)

We can download a single file to take a look at the data structure and make the following observations about the data:

### Observations

- It is available in weekly batches every Sunday
- The information is audited in blocks of four hours apart
- The date and time field are on different columns
- The cumulative entries are on the ENTRIES field
- The cumulative exits are on the EXITS field
- This data is audited in blocks of four hours apart

### Fields Description


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
C/A      | Control Area (A002) (Booth)
UNIT     | Remote Unit for a station (R051)
SCP      | Subunit Channel Position represents a specific address for a device (02-00-00)
STATION  | Represents the station name the device is located at
LINENAME | Represents all train lines that can be boarded at this station. Normally lines are represented by one character.  LINENAME 456NQR represents train server for 4, 5, 6, N, Q, and R trains.
DIVISION | Represents the Line originally the station belonged to BMT, IRT, or IND   
DATE     | Represents the date (MM-DD-YY)
TIME     | Represents the time (hh:mm:ss) for a scheduled audit event
DESC     | Represent the "REGULAR" scheduled audit event (Normally occurs every 4 hours). Audits may occur more than 4 hours due to planning, or troubleshooting activities. Additionally, there may be a "RECOVR AUD" entry: This refers to missed audit that was recovered. 
ENTRIES  | The cumulative entry register value for a device
EXIST    | The cumulative exit register value for a device

### Data Example

The data below shows the entry/exit register values for one turnstile at control area (A002) from 09/27/14 00:00 to 09/29/14 at 08:00.


|C/A|UNIT|SCP|STATION|LINENAME|DIVISION|DATE|TIME|DESC|ENTRIES|EXITS|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A002|R051|02-00-00|LEXINGTON AVE|456NQR|BMT|09-27-14|00:00:00|REGULAR|0004800073|0001629137|
A002|R051|02-00-00|LEXINGTON AVE|456NQR|BMT|09-27-14|04:00:00|REGULAR|0004800125|0001629149|
A002|R051|02-00-00|LEXINGTON AVE|456NQR|BMT|09-27-14|08:00:00|REGULAR|0004800146|0001629162|


### Conclusions

Based on observations, the following conclusions can be made:

- Merge the DATE and TIME columns and create a date time column, CREATED
- The STATION column is a location dimension
- The CREATED column is the datetime dimension to enable the morning and afternoon timeframes
- The ENTRIES column  is the measure for entries
- The EXITS column is the measure for exits
- A gate can be identified by using the C/A, SCP and UNIT columns

### Requirements

These observations can be used to define technical requirements that can enable us to deliver a successful project.

- Define the infrastructure requirements to host the technology
  - Automate the provisioning of the resources using Terraform
  - Deploy the technology on a cloud platform
- Define the data orchestration process
  - On the original pipeline, load the initial data for 2023
  - Create a data pipeline that runs every week after a new file has been published
  - Copy the unstructured CSV files into a Data Lake
- Define a well-structured and optimized model on a Data Warehouse
  - Keep the source code for the models under source control
  - Copy the data into the Data Warehouse
  - Allow access to the Data Warehouse, so visualization tools can consume the data.
- Create Data Analysis dashboard with the following information  
  - Data Analysis dashboard
  - Identify the time slots for morning and afternoon analysis
  - Look at the distribution by stations
  - Look at the daily models
  - Look at the time slot models

## Review the Code

To facilitate our data analysis, the initial step involves downloading sample data through a Python script. Subsequently, we analyze this data using code snippets, harnessing the capabilities of the Python Pandas library. Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks are employed for efficient data manipulation and the creation of charts, serving as baseline requirements for the final visualization dashboard.

### Download a CSV File from the MTA Site

With this Python script (mta_discovery.py), we download a CSV file with the URL of http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_230318.txt. The code creates a data stream to download the file in chunks to avoid any timeouts. We append the chunks into a local compressed file to reduce the size of the file. In order to reuse this code, we use the command line parser, so we can pass as parameters the URL.

```python

### Analyze the Data

With our sample data in hand, let's delve into the analysis. There are various approaches to this task. While we could create another Python script to manipulate the data, this would require running the script from the console after each code change. A more efficient method is to utilize Jupyter Notebooks. This tool allows us to edit and run code snippets in cells without executing the entire script. Serving as a user-friendly analysis tool, Jupyter Notebooks enable us to focus on data analysis without the need for constant coding and script execution. Furthermore, once satisfied with our changes, the notebook can be exported into a Python file. Let's explore the contents of the 'discovery.ipynb' file:

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import argparse
from time import time
from pathlib import Path

# Load other libraries
import pandas as pd     

# read the file and display the top 10 rows
df = pd.read_csv('../data/230318.csv.gz', iterator=False,compression="gzip")
df.head(10)

# Create a new DateTime column and merge the DATE and TIME columns
df['CREATED'] =  pd.to_datetime(df['DATE'] + ' ' + df['TIME'], format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S')
df = df.drop('DATE', axis=1).drop('TIME',axis=1)
df.info(10)

# Define the set of special characters you want to check for

def has_special_characters(col, special_characters):
    # Check if any character in the column name is not alphanumeric or in the specified set
    return any(char in special_characters for char in col)

def rename_columns(df, special_characters_set):
    # Create a mapping of old column names to new column names
    mapping = {col: ''.join(char for char in col if char.isalnum() or char not in special_characters_set) for col in df.columns}

    print(mapping)
    # Rename columns using the mapping
    df_renamed = df.rename(columns=mapping)
    
    return df_renamed

# Define the set of special characters you want to check for
special_characters_set = set('@#$%/')

# Identify columns with special characters
columns_with_special_characters = [col for col in df.columns if has_special_characters(col, special_characters_set)]

# Print the result
print("Columns with special characters:", columns_with_special_characters)

# Identify columns with special characters and rename them
df = rename_columns(df, special_characters_set)

print(df.info())

# Aggregate the information by station and datetime
df["ENTRIES"] = df["ENTRIES"].astype(int)
df["EXITS"] = df["EXITS"].astype(int)
df_totals = df.groupby(["STATION","CREATED"], as_index=False)[["ENTRIES","EXITS"]].sum()
df_totals.head(10)

df_station_totals = df.groupby(["STATION"], as_index=False)[["ENTRIES","EXITS"]].sum()
df_station_totals.head(10)

# Show the total entries by station, use a subset of data
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
 
df_stations =  df_station_totals.head(25)
donut_chart = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=df_stations["STATION"], values=df_stations["ENTRIES"], hole=.2)])
donut_chart.update_layout(title_text='Entries Distribution by Station', margin=dict(t=40, b=0, l=10, r=10))
donut_chart.show()

# Show the data by the day of the week
df_by_date = df_totals.groupby(["CREATED"], as_index=False)[["ENTRIES"]].sum()
day_order = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
df_by_date["WEEKDAY"] = pd.Categorical(df_by_date["CREATED"].dt.strftime('%a'), categories=day_order, ordered=True)
df_entries_by_date =  df_by_date.groupby(["WEEKDAY"], as_index=False)[["ENTRIES"]].sum()
df_entries_by_date.head(10)

bar_chart = go.Figure(data=[go.Bar(x=df_entries_by_date["WEEKDAY"], y=df_entries_by_date["ENTRIES"])])
bar_chart.update_layout(title_text='Total Entries by Week Day')
bar_chart.show()

```

## Conclusion

We've just wrapped up our discovery analysis by using a dataset from MTA. We leveraged Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Jupyter Notebook to help us write code for the data discovery. Our mission was to delve into the data's details, make our observations, perform distribution analysis, and create some insightful charts using Plotly and Pandas. The aim? Running our discovery process, paving the way to pinpoint requirements for the next phase in the process, and building a solid understanding of the data. 

## Next Step

With our problem statement, requirements, and data exploration successfully completed, we now embark upon the next phase of our data engineering journey: designing and planning the solution.
